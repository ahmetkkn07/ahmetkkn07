## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Ahmet

<p>
  I am currently a fourth year computer engineering student. I like to solve problems. I am curious and I can learn programming languages and technologies that I donâ€™t know. I follow the news about new computer hardware. I am interested in. BackEnd, FrontEnd development, OOP, and developing embedded systems. Also I like to take nature photos and I am interested in Hackintosh.
  
  I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis about optical mark recognition with Python and OpenCV.
